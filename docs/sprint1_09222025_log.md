# Sprint 1 Log - September 22, 2025

## Summary of Work

Today was focused on debugging and completing the Garmin integration layer, specifically getting the Python service to successfully log in to Garmin Connect and fetch activity data. We also addressed several Git-related issues and refined the testing process.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Application Startup Failure (Database Connection Refused)

*   **Issue:** The Spring Boot application failed to start with a `Connection refused` error to PostgreSQL (`localhost:5432`).
*   **Diagnosis:** `docker-compose ps` showed no containers running.
*   **Resolution:** Started Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d`.

### 2. Git Branching Confusion & Untracked Files

*   **Issue:** Confusion regarding `dev` being behind `main`, and `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` being ahead of its remote. `git status` showed untracked `target/` files preventing branch switching.
*   **Diagnosis:** `git log --graph` revealed `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` was merged directly into `main`, and `dev` was not fully up-to-date. The `target/` directory was being tracked despite `.gitignore`.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Used `git rm -r --cached target` and committed to untrack the `target/` directory.
    *   Updated local `main` branch (`git pull origin main`).
    *   Merged `main` into `dev` (`git merge main`) to bring `dev` up-to-date.
    *   Pushed all local commits on `dev` and `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` to their respective remotes.
    *   Confirmed the correct Git workflow: `feature -> dev -> main` for future PRs.

### 3. `GET /api/python/hello` 403 Forbidden Error

*   **Issue:** Accessing `/api/python/hello` resulted in a 403 Forbidden error.
*   **Diagnosis:** `SecurityConfig.java` was configured to require authentication for `anyRequest()`, except `/api/auth/login`.
*   **Resolution:** Proposed modifying `SecurityConfig.java` to `permitAll()` for `/api/python/hello`. (This change was not implemented as we pursued authenticated testing).

### 4. Python Service 404 Not Found for `/hello`

*   **Issue:** After authenticating, calling `/api/python/hello` resulted in a `404 Not Found` from the Python service.
*   **Diagnosis:** `docker-compose.yml` was configured to run `garmin_api.py`, not `hello.py`. The `/hello` endpoint was defined in `hello.py`.
*   **Resolution:** Merged the `/hello` endpoint from `hello.py` into `garmin_api.py` to consolidate the Python services.

### 5. `docker-compose exec` Producing No Output

*   **Issue:** `docker-compose exec` commands (e.g., `python3 script.py`, `bash`) produced no output, making debugging difficult.
*   **Diagnosis:** Confirmed containers were `Up` and environment variables were set. Attempting `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` also failed initially.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Restarted Docker daemon (`sudo systemctl restart docker`).
    *   Discovered `docker-compose exec` was still failing silently.
    *   Successfully used `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` to get an interactive shell, indicating the problem was with `docker-compose exec` itself, not the Docker daemon or container.

### 6. Garmin Connect Login Failure ("Unexpected title")

*   **Issue:** The `garminconnect` library failed to log in to Garmin Connect with the error "Login failed: Unexpected title: GARMIN Authentication Application". This occurred even when using correct credentials and after confirming manual web login worked.
*   **Diagnosis:** This is a common issue with screen-scraping libraries when the target website (Garmin) changes its login page or security measures.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Modified `garmin_api.py` to pass a specific `User-Agent` (`com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile`) to the `Garmin` constructor.
    *   Rebuilt and restarted Docker containers.
    *   **Result:** This resolved the login issue, and the `garminconnect` library was able to successfully log in and fetch data.

### Docker Compose Exec Troubleshooting (Persistent Issue)

*   **Issue:** `docker-compose exec` commands consistently failed with "service is not running" or produced no output, despite containers being `Up`.
*   **Attempts & Diagnosis:**
    *   **Initial `docker-compose exec` failure:** No output from `python3 script.py` or `bash`.
    *   **Restarting Docker daemon:** `sudo systemctl restart docker` and `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`. Did not resolve `exec` issue.
    *   **Direct `docker exec` with `bash`:** `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` successfully provided a shell, indicating `docker-compose exec` was the problem, not the Docker daemon or container.
    *   **`KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'` during `docker compose up --build`:** Encountered due to outdated `docker-compose` (V1) incompatibility with newer Docker daemon.
    *   **Resolution Attempt:** Updated `docker-compose` to V2 (`docker compose version v2.39.4`).
    *   **Result:** `docker compose up -d --build` now works, but `docker compose exec` still fails.
*   **Current Status:** `docker-compose exec` remains non-functional. We are using `docker exec` directly for container interactions. This is a persistent environment issue on the user's system.

## Today's Achievements

*   Successfully debugged and resolved the `garminconnect` login issue by adding a specific `User-Agent`.
*   Confirmed end-to-end functionality of the Garmin integration layer: Java app login -> Java calls Python service -> Python logs into Garmin -> Python fetches activities -> Python returns activities to Java -> Java returns activities to client.
*   Cleaned up Git history and ensured `dev` branch is up-to-date with `main`.
*   Created a robust testing script (`test_garmin.sh`) for the Garmin integration.

## Next Steps (from Sprint Plan)

Finish day 3-4   evne though we are not using procesBuilder anymore, (we are using Flask)  the gist of day3-4 remains the same:we need ` wgarmin_auth.py` - Authentication and session validation (done)
  - `garmin_activities.py` - Activity list retrieval with date filtering (done)

    NOT DONE
  - `garmin_activity_detail.py` - Individual activity download with FIT files
  - `garmin_health.py` - Health metrics and daily summaries
  - `garmin_utils.py` - Shared utilities and error handling
- [ ] JSON communication protocol with error code standardization
- [ ] Process management with timeout handling and resource cleanup
- [ ] Credential encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for both Java and Python failures# Sprint 1 Log - September 22, 2025

## Monday, September 22, 2025 - Debugging Session Summary

**Issue:** Python Docker service not building/running after adding activity detail download feature; tests failing.

**Debugging Steps & Outcomes:**

1.  **Initial Problem:** Python service not building/running.
    *   **Action:** Reviewed `docker-compose.yml`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Outdated `garminconnect` library.
    *   **Fix:** Updated `garminconnect` from `0.1.1` to `0.2.30` in `requirements.txt`.
    *   **Outcome:** Docker build succeeded, but container still exited immediately.

2.  **First Runtime Error:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'ActivityDownloadFormat' from 'garminconnect'`.
    *   **Action:** Checked `docker logs golden-bridge-python`.
    *   **Hypothesis:** Incorrect import path for `ActivityDownloadFormat` in `garmin_api.py` for `garminconnect==0.2.30`.
    *   **Attempted Fix 1:** Changed import to `from garminconnect import ActivityDownloadFormat`.
    *   **Outcome:** Error persisted.
    *   **Attempted Fix 2:** Changed import to `from garminconnect.dtos import ActivityDownloadFormat` (based on web search).
    *   **Outcome:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'garminconnect.dtos'`.

3.  **Breakthrough - Direct Container Inspection:**
    *   **Action:** Temporarily modified `docker-compose.yml` to keep `golden-bridge-python` container running (`command: tail -f /dev/null`).
    *   **Action:** Executed `docker exec golden-bridge-python python -c "import garminconnect; help(garminconnect)"` inside the container.
    *   **Discovery:** `ActivityDownloadFormat` was found as an attribute of the `Garmin` class (e.g., `garminconnect.Garmin.ActivityDownloadFormat`).
    *   **Fix:** Reverted `garmin_api.py` import to *not* directly import `ActivityDownloadFormat`, and modified the call site in `download_activity` to `dl_fmt=api_client.ActivityDownloadFormat.FIT`.
    *   **Outcome:** Python container started successfully.

4.  **Test Failures - Mocking Issues:**
    *   **Problem:** `test_garmin_activity_download_success` failed with `AssertionError: 500 != 200`.
    *   **Action:** Added `print(f"Error in download_activity: {e}")` to `garmin_api.py` to capture the exception.
    *   **Discovery:** `AttributeError: 'MockGarmin' object has no attribute 'ActivityDownloadFormat'`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a nested `ActivityDownloadFormat` class to `MockGarmin` in `test_garmin_api.py`.
    *   **Outcome:** `test_garmin_activity_download_success` passed, but `test_garmin_logout` failed with `AttributeError: 'MockGarmin' object has no attribute 'logout'`.
    *   **Fix:** Added a `logout` method to `MockGarmin` in `test_garmin_api.py`.
    *   **Outcome:** All 11 tests passed.

**Final Resolution:** The Python Docker service now builds, runs, and all associated tests pass, resolving the issues stemming from the `garminconnect` library update and subsequent mocking requirements.
