# Sprint 1 Log - September 22, 2025

## Summary of Work

Today was focused on debugging and completing the Garmin integration layer, specifically getting the Python service to successfully log in to Garmin Connect and fetch activity data. We also addressed several Git-related issues and refined the testing process.

## Issues Encountered & Resolutions

### 1. Application Startup Failure (Database Connection Refused)

*   **Issue:** The Spring Boot application failed to start with a `Connection refused` error to PostgreSQL (`localhost:5432`).
*   **Diagnosis:** `docker-compose ps` showed no containers running.
*   **Resolution:** Started Docker containers using `docker-compose up -d`.

### 2. Git Branching Confusion & Untracked Files

*   **Issue:** Confusion regarding `dev` being behind `main`, and `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` being ahead of its remote. `git status` showed untracked `target/` files preventing branch switching.
*   **Diagnosis:** `git log --graph` revealed `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` was merged directly into `main`, and `dev` was not fully up-to-date. The `target/` directory was being tracked despite `.gitignore`.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Used `git rm -r --cached target` and committed to untrack the `target/` directory.
    *   Updated local `main` branch (`git pull origin main`).
    *   Merged `main` into `dev` (`git merge main`) to bring `dev` up-to-date.
    *   Pushed all local commits on `dev` and `feature/sprint1_day3_4_garmin_integration` to their respective remotes.
    *   Confirmed the correct Git workflow: `feature -> dev -> main` for future PRs.

### 3. `GET /api/python/hello` 403 Forbidden Error

*   **Issue:** Accessing `/api/python/hello` resulted in a 403 Forbidden error.
*   **Diagnosis:** `SecurityConfig.java` was configured to require authentication for `anyRequest()`, except `/api/auth/login`.
*   **Resolution:** Proposed modifying `SecurityConfig.java` to `permitAll()` for `/api/python/hello`. (This change was not implemented as we pursued authenticated testing).

### 4. Python Service 404 Not Found for `/hello`

*   **Issue:** After authenticating, calling `/api/python/hello` resulted in a `404 Not Found` from the Python service.
*   **Diagnosis:** `docker-compose.yml` was configured to run `garmin_api.py`, not `hello.py`. The `/hello` endpoint was defined in `hello.py`.
*   **Resolution:** Merged the `/hello` endpoint from `hello.py` into `garmin_api.py` to consolidate the Python services.

### 5. `docker-compose exec` Producing No Output

*   **Issue:** `docker-compose exec` commands (e.g., `python3 script.py`, `bash`) produced no output, making debugging difficult.
*   **Diagnosis:** Confirmed containers were `Up` and environment variables were set. Attempting `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` also failed initially.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Restarted Docker daemon (`sudo systemctl restart docker`).
    *   Discovered `docker-compose exec` was still failing silently.
    *   Successfully used `docker exec -it <container_id> bash` to get an interactive shell, indicating the problem was with `docker-compose exec` itself, not the Docker daemon or container.

### 6. Garmin Connect Login Failure ("Unexpected title")

*   **Issue:** The `garminconnect` library failed to log in to Garmin Connect with the error "Login failed: Unexpected title: GARMIN Authentication Application". This occurred even when using correct credentials and after confirming manual web login worked.
*   **Diagnosis:** This is a common issue with screen-scraping libraries when the target website (Garmin) changes its login page or security measures.
*   **Resolution:**
    *   Modified `garmin_api.py` to pass a specific `User-Agent` (`com.garmin.android.apps.connectmobile`) to the `Garmin` constructor.
    *   Rebuilt and restarted Docker containers.
    *   **Result:** This resolved the login issue, and the `garminconnect` library was able to successfully log in and fetch data.

## Today's Achievements

*   Successfully debugged and resolved the `garminconnect` login issue by adding a specific `User-Agent`.
*   Confirmed end-to-end functionality of the Garmin integration layer: Java app login -> Java calls Python service -> Python logs into Garmin -> Python fetches activities -> Python returns activities to Java -> Java returns activities to client.
*   Cleaned up Git history and ensured `dev` branch is up-to-date with `main`.
*   Created a robust testing script (`test_garmin.sh`) for the Garmin integration.

## Next Steps (from Sprint Plan)

Finish day 3-4   evne though we are not using procesBuilder anymore, (we are using Flask)  the gist of day3-4 remains the same:we need ` wgarmin_auth.py` - Authentication and session validation (done)
  - `garmin_activities.py` - Activity list retrieval with date filtering (done)

    NOT DONE
  - `garmin_activity_detail.py` - Individual activity download with FIT files
  - `garmin_health.py` - Health metrics and daily summaries
  - `garmin_utils.py` - Shared utilities and error handling
- [ ] JSON communication protocol with error code standardization
- [ ] Process management with timeout handling and resource cleanup
- [ ] Credential encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling for both Java and Python failures

## Current Status & Next Steps (September 22, 2025 - End of Session)

The reason we are currently troubleshooting Docker container issues is because running the Python unit tests (which you wanted to do) requires executing commands inside the `golden-bridge-python` Docker container. We discovered that `docker-compose exec` was failing silently, preventing us from running any commands (including `pytest` or even a simple `bash` shell) inside the container. This indicates a fundamental problem with the Docker execution environment that needs to be resolved before we can reliably run tests or deploy the Python service.

We encountered a critical `KeyError: 'ContainerConfig'` when trying to rebuild Docker containers (`docker-compose up -d --build`). This indicates an incompatibility between the current `docker-compose` version (1.29.2) and the Docker daemon.

**Immediate Next Step:** Update `docker-compose` to a newer version (preferably Docker Compose V2). This is a system-level change that needs to be performed manually.

**Once `docker-compose` is updated, the next steps will be:**
1.  Run `docker-compose up -d --build` again.
2.  Try running the Python tests (`pytest /app/python-scripts/test_garmin_api.py` inside the container).
3.  If tests pass, try the full `curl` sequence to confirm end-to-end functionality.

## Important `curl` Commands for Testing

These commands are essential for interacting with the application's API:

### 1. Get JWT Token (Application Login)

Authenticates with the Java application and retrieves a JWT access token.

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username":"testuser", "password":"password"}' http://localhost:8080/api/auth/login | jq -r .accessToken)
```

### 2. Log In to Garmin (via Python Service)

Uses the JWT token to authorize with the Java application, which then passes your Garmin credentials to the Python service to log in to Garmin's servers.

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -d '{"username":"YOUR_GARMIN_EMAIL", "password":"YOUR_GARMIN_PASSWORD"}' http://localhost:8080/api/auth/garmin/login
```

### 3. Check Garmin Login Status

Verifies if the Python service is currently logged in to Garmin Connect. Requires a valid JWT token.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/api/auth/garmin/status
```

### 4. Fetch Activities (List)

Retrieves a list of activities from Garmin Connect via the Python service. Requires a valid JWT token.

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8080/api/garmin/activities?limit=5"
```

### 5. Fetch Activity Details (Individual)

Retrieves detailed information for a specific activity from Garmin Connect. Requires a valid JWT token. Replace `<activity_id>` with an actual ID.

```bash
bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "http://localhost:8080/api/garmin/activity_detail/<activity_id>"
```
